MuK Converter

Technical module to provide some utility features and libraries that can be used
in other applications. This module has no direct effect on the running system.

Requirements
=============

unoconv
-------------

Universal Office Converter (unoconv) is a command line tool to convert any
document format that LibreOffice can import to any document format that
LibreOffice can export. It makes use of the LibreOffice's UNO bindings for
non-interactive conversion of documents.

To install unoconv please follow the instructions (`here <https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv>`_).

Make sure that unoconv can be executed from the console and the conversion 
is done correctly.

To set an individual path for the LibreOffice installation, the config
variable ``uno_path`` can be set accordingly in the Odoo config.

Under Windows you should rename the ``unoconv`` file to ``unoconv.py`` and set
the corresponding path for the ``uno_path`` variable. Since it does not work
reliably with the environment variable ``UNO_PATH``.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

Download the module and add it to your Odoo addons folder. Afterward, log on to
your Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the debug mode and update the
list by clicking on the "Update Apps List" link. Now install the module by
clicking on the install button.

Another way to install this module is via the package management for Python
(`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_).

To install our modules using the package manager make sure
`odoo-autodiscover <https://pypi.org/project/odoo-autodiscover/>`_ is installed
correctly. Then open a console and install the module by entering the following
command:

``pip install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``

The module name consists of the Odoo version and the module name, where
underscores are replaced by a dash.

**Module:** 

``odoo<version>-addon-<module_name>``

**Example:**

``sudo -H pip3 install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple odoo11-addon-muk-utils``

Once the installation has been successfully completed, the app is already in the
correct folder. Log on to your Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the 
debug mode and update the list by clicking on the "Update Apps List" link. Now
install the module by clicking on the install button.

The biggest advantage of this variant is that you can now also update the app
using the "pip" command. To do this, enter the following command in your console:

``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``

When the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in 
Odoo. The steps are the same as for the installation only the button has changed
from "Install" to "Upgrade".

You can also view available Apps directly in our `repository <https://nexus.mukit.at/#browse/browse:odoo>`_
and find a more detailed installation guide on our `website <https://mukit.at/page/open-source>`_.

For modules licensed under OPL-1, you will receive access data when you purchase
the module. If the modules were not purchased directly from
`MuK IT <https://www.mukit.at/>`_ please contact our support (support@mukit.at)
with a confirmation of purchase to receive the corresponding access data.

Upgrade
============

To upgrade this module, you need to:

Download the module and add it to your Odoo addons folder. Restart the server
and log on to your Odoo server. Select the Apps menu and upgrade the module by
clicking on the upgrade button.

If you installed the module using the "pip" command, you can also update the
module in the same way. Just type the following command into the console:

``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``

When the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in 
Odoo, just like you would normally.

Configuration
=============

The converter uses a store to avoid the repeated conversion of the same file.
To avoid unnecessary memory consumption, Odoo's AutoVaccum Cron Job empties
the store accordingly. The system parameter ``muk_converter.max_store`` can
be used to set the maximum number of elements that can be in the store after
cleaning. By default, this value is set to 20.

Usage
=============

This module has no direct visible effect on the system. It provides functions
to convert data from one file format to another.
